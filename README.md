# Vectorial-Embedding-Matrix
Objective: to explore a framework which transfers multi-relational data with missing values and categorical features to 
low-dimensional vector representation in machine learning applications, which ensures the accuracy of data;

· Transformed multi-relational data into low-dimensional matrix through knowledge graph embedding representation 
methods, which can reveal inferences and relationships that are not directly addressed by a single relational table;

· Conducted evaluations on binary and multi-classification datasets using: a baseline logistic regression with one-hot 
encoding, XGBoost model with one-hot encoding and fixed-length knowledge embeddings, and a neural network 
BiLSTM-Attention model with variable-length knowledge embeddings;

· F1-score evaluation revealed that embedding-based models outperformed those using one-hot encoding by 7% to 46%, 
highlighting embeddings' superior capacity for information conveyance, confirming the effectiveness of embedding 
vectorsin enhancing data representation and relational understanding, thereby improving classification task performance.
